This house-hunters app was created as a bootcamp student project group challenge. This app is a javascript property information finder. 
By using geocoding, user can convert an address into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) that can be used to locate a place on a map. USer can then use the coordinates to display the data around that location such as nearby property information. The location will then be stored in the local storage for future reference.
The code of this app was created from scratch. 

House-hunters application uses two APIs to get search result : 

1. Geocode API (https://geocode.maps.co/). Using this API, application receive latitude and longitude from the address user typed. 


2. Attom API (https://api.developer.attomdata.com/docs).
